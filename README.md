# Dawah - Open Source Islamic Video Platform
Dawah is an open-source Islamic video platform built with Flutter. It uses YouTube metadata to fetch and display specific videos and channel information. With a collection of over 50K videos from 100+ Islamic channels, the app allows users to explore, search, and filter content easily. To enhance performance, Dawah processes queries directly on the device using SQLite for local storage.

This application is highly secure as it operates without a backend server, ensuring user privacy and data safety. However, Dawah is not an offline platform—it fetches real-time updates from YouTube while maintaining efficient on-device processing for a smooth user experience.
